# Lab 9
## Question 1

No assembly to display (~5 lines filtered)
## Question 3
It does not.
## Question 4
## QUestion 5
your function:          time:   [45.665 ms 45.669 ms 45.674 ms]
Found 3 outliers among 100 measurements (3.00%)
  2 (2.00%) high mild
  1 (1.00%) high severe
## Question 6
## Question 7
your function:          time:   [60.540 ms 60.547 ms 60.554 ms]
## Question 8
The use of iterators seems to have slowed the code down.
## Question 9
An abstraction refers to hiding details about implementation behind function calls, methods, libraries, etc. A zero cost abstraction is an abstraction that doesn't slow down the execution or use more memory. My code for Question 6 fails to utilize a zero cost abstractions, as the use of iterators seems to have introduced overhead.
